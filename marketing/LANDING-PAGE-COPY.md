## Why Orbital Section

### Header
# Why students love Orbital

### Card 1: Instant
**No waiting. No searching.**
YouTube has great tutorials — if you can find the right one. Orbital generates exactly what you need, for your exact problem, right now.

### Card 2: It talks to you
**Like a tutor in your headphones.**
Every step is narrated out loud. Pause. Rewind. Listen again. It's like having a patient tutor who never gets tired of explaining.

### Card 3: It shows the work
**Animated math you can follow.**
Watch equations transform step by step. See exactly where each number comes from. No more "how did they get that?"

### Card 4: Available at 2am
**When you need it most.**
Finals week. Sunday night. 3am panic. Your tutor is asleep. Orbital isn't.

> — **@premed_pain**

> "Used it for my entire Calc 2 class. Went from a D to a B+."
> — **@jake_engineering**

> "The fact that it does PROOFS is insane. Induction, epsilon-delta, everything."

# A/B Test Ideas

1. **Headline:** "Type a problem. Get a video." vs "Stop staring at problems you don't understand."
2. **CTA:** "Solve Your First Problem Free" vs "Try It Free" vs "Watch the Demo"
3. **Pricing anchor:** Show Pro first (anchoring) vs Free first (low barrier)
4. **Social proof:** Tweets vs star ratings vs video testimonials
