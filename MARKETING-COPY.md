"POV: You're looking for a video that explains YOUR calculus problem..."

[Shows 10 videos, none match]
"...and none of them are the exact problem you have"

[Cut to Orbital]
"Or you could just type it in and get a video made FOR YOU in 20 seconds"

[Shows video generating]
"Math homework should not take 3 hours because you can't find a good tutorial"

[Shows finished video]
"Orbital. Your problem. Your video. Done."
```

### Script 2: "Speedrun"
```
[Timer starts at 0:00]
"Let's see how fast I can understand this calculus problem"

[Types problem: "Find the derivative of x³ + 2x² - 5x + 1"]
"Type it in..."

[Shows parsing]
"AI breaks it down..."

[Shows video generating]
"Video generating..."

[Timer shows ~35 seconds, video plays]
"And done. Step-by-step video. Under a minute."

"That would've been 20 minutes of scrolling on YouTube. Link in bio."
```

### Script 3: "For Visual Learners"
```
"If you're a visual learner who HATES reading math solutions..."

[Shows wall of text explanation]
"This is painful, right?"

[Cut to Orbital video playing]
"But THIS? This makes sense."

"Orbital turns any math problem into a video tutorial with animations and narration."

"Finally, homework that doesn't make me want to cry."

## 💬 Key Messaging Themes

### For Gen Z
- **Anti-struggle culture:** "Why suffer when AI exists?"
- **Time value:** "Your time is worth more than endless scrolling"
- **Instant gratification:** "Done in 20 seconds, not 30 minutes"
- **Aesthetic:** "It's giving Tesla, not 2005 Khan Academy"

### Pain Points to Hit
1. Can't find a YouTube video that matches your exact problem
2. 20-minute videos where you only need 2 minutes of it
3. Text-based solutions that don't click
4. Expensive tutoring you can't afford
5. Textbook explanations that make no sense

### Differentiators
- **vs PhotoMath:** "They show steps. We show a VIDEO."
- **vs YouTube:** "Custom video for YOUR problem in 20 seconds"
- **vs Tutors:** "$2, not $50/hour"
- **vs Chegg/Course Hero:** "Understand it, don't just copy it"
